# Unity Built-in Shaders
This repository contains built-in shader code for all release of Unity back to Unity 3.
It is useful to compare changes between versions and keep up to date versions of Unity's own shaders (you do not need to download the code from Unity's website anymore!)

## Exceptions

Only fully released versions of Unity are taken into account. Releases from the Alpha, Beta or Patch channels are not considered.
